# Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search-Agent-for-the-Game-of-HEX
MONTE Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a method for finding optimal decisions in a given domain by taking random samples in the decision space and building a search tree according to the results. It has already had a profound impact on Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches for domains that can be represented as trees of sequential decisions, particularly games and planning problems. In this project I used different simulation strategies to enhance the agent policy to explore the environment.
